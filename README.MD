Circle-Language-Spec
====================

*JJ van Zon, 2021-02-17*

Circle would be an unfinished programming language. It aims to once become a diagram notation for visualizing computer code.

You may find the following folders here:

- [Spec](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/1.%20Spec)
    - Not done yet. However, more finished up content might be found here. It might once form a specification of this language.
- [Broader View](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/2.%20Broader%20View)
    - Various draft texts that may once describe a story, ideas about how this Circle language might be used in practice. The folder may not be organized that well yet.
- [Construct Drafts](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/3.%20Constructs%20Drafts)
    - It may contain drafts of ideas that might not become part of the spec. Or language constructs that are just not as clear worked out yet. Best not to expect too much from the content in this folder. It might just be a glorified recycle bin.
- [Archive](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/4.%20Archive)

The material may still be a bit rough. Both in content and writing style.

It might be made better step by step. The current goal (as of February, 2021) would be converting the Word documents to MarkDown.

Would anyone be interested. Another repository would describe the plans, notes and TODO's around this project. Here it is: [Circle-Language-Spec-Plans](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans)
