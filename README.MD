Circle-Language-Spec
====================

*JJ van Zon, 2021-02-17*

Circle would be an unfinished programming language. It aims to once become a diagram notation for visualizing computer code.

The material may still be a bit rough around the edges. Both in content and writing style.

Effort may  be made tidying it up step by step. The current goal (as of February, 2021) would be converting the Word documents to MarkDown.

The following folders might be found:

- Spec
    - Not done yet. However, more finished up content might be found here. It might once form a specification of this language.
- Broader View
    - Various draft texts that may once describe a story, ideas about how this Circle language might be used in practice. The folder may not be organized that well yet.
- Construct Drafts
    - It may contain drafts of ideas that might not become part of the spec. Or language constructs that are just not as clear worked out yet. Best not to expect too much from the content in this folder. It might disparagingly be called the glorified recycle bin of this repository.

Would anyone be interested. Another repository would describe the plans, notes and TODO's around this project. Here it is: [Circle-Language-Spec-Plans](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans)
