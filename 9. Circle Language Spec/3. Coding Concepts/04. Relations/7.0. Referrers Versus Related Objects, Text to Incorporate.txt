Referrers are handy, when so many
classes relate to another class,
that the other class does not want
to maintain a separate list for each
class that links to it.

It is also handy for when a class
can't be aware of its related classes,
so can not automatically get a relation
back to classes, that want to link to it.
In that case the other class can not
establish a dual relation with
the remote class, probably,
because it does not have permission
to alter the remote class.
Or the remote class denies
dual relationships to it altogether.

To make the remote class or object
aware of its referrers anyway,
you can let it support the referrers concept.
