Overview
--------

This documentation folder describes the new computer programming language. This is the most important part of the documentation.

It includes explanations of a diagram notation for visualizing program code and the fundamental principles of a new computer programming language. It contains explanations of how coding concepts are implemented inside the new computer programming language: coding concepts such as objects, classes, relations, interfaces, input output, commands and parameters. Several experimental versions of a new computer programming language have been developed, but not yet the final one.

This documentation folder contains the following sub-folders:

### Code Concepts

This documentation folder explains how basic coding concepts are implemented inside the new computer programming language: concepts such as objects, classes, relations, interfaces, input output, commands and parameters. Each concept is explained both conceptually as well as in the form of a diagram notation. About 70% of the concepts are well-described. Those are put at the beginning of the documentation. They draw out a good picture of what the language looks like and how the diagram notation is applied. 30% percent of the concepts is not adequately described yet. Those are put at the end of this documentation folder.

### Expression

This folder covers the different kinds of ways you can express systematics. The basic ideas about a diagram notation were already covered at the beginning of the new computer language documentation, because it was important to quickly introduce those. The diagram expression is also explained throughout the code concepts documentation. This part of the documentation will cover the remaining topics about the diagram expression.

The idea behind expression in general is that a program’s systematics are not described by text code, but text code as well as the diagram notation are a mere expression of systematics, stored in a binary way as interlinked objects. Much of this documentation folder is a mere throw-together of ideas or pieces of text, that came out of previous descriptions of new computer programming languages.

Text code and diagram expression can be complemented by any other form of expression. Displaying data in tabular form is another form of expression. Expressing data and commands in a graphical windows user interface is also an alternative form of expression of systematics. Furthermore, certain objects have specialized expressions. For instance a sound object may be expressed by playing its sound, but not all objects can be expressed by playing it as sound. All expressions are considered alternative expressions of systematics, just like text code and diagram code.

### Other Topics

This folder contains topics regarding the new computer language, that are either boring, trivial or just too advanced and go too far for now. All in all: topics, that are not important enough to cover yet.
