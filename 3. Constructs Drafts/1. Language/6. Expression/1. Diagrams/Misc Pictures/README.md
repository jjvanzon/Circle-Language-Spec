## **Example Diagrams**
This folder contains an archive file with pictures in it, that were just too inspiring to throw away. Even though the documentation is plastered with diagram images, some of the ones in the archive are made while analysing real programming situations. One of them was even the very first one I ever made. Others show an impression of how it would feel to operate a diagram in an actual application. It reminds me of what I am doing it all for.
