The Class concept
adds more New and Annul
system commands, than just the New and Annul
of a related item.


Class's implementation as a concept,
2008-06-10

A class adds a sub object to the system interface,
a procedure on object assignment of this sub object,
which configures the object that gets the class.
It will also change the diagram expression module.
