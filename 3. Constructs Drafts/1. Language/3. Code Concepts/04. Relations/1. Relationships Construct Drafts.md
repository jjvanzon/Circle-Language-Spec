Relationships Construct Drafts
------------------------------

### Relationships Between Classes

The class-relationship structure is the bonestructure of a program.

### Bidirectional Relationships

The notation suggested here was moved away from the Circle Language Spec in favor of another notation.

Starting with:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.001.png)

A suggested notation would be for the two class lines to merge together to form the picture below:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.002.png)

This, however, might be a quite ambiguous notation. It would suggest that the two symbols joined by the line would have the same class. But that would not be what is intended. The circle inside __Class A__ would have __Class B__ and the circle inside __Class B__ would have __Class A__.

A solution to this ambiguity may be proposed.

Fortunately, the notation can be disambiguated using the rules of automatic containment. Automatic containment is explained in the article *Automatic Containment*. Before explaining how automatic containment leads to the eventual notation, here is the disambiguated notation of a relationship between two classes:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.003.png)

The notation is accomplished by first taking the original picture with one class refering to another and the other refering back to the first class:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.001.png)

Then, an imaginary reference to each class is added to the diagram

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.004.png)

Next, the class lines are merged, but also the class symbols are merged:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.003.png)

The notation would still be ambiguous, if it weren’t for the double dashed line of the merged class symbols. So a double dashed circle symbolizes a relationship between classes.

Examples with different multiplicities:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.005.png)

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.006.png)

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.007.png)

A symbol merge in a relationship that has nonagons in it also results in a double dashed circle, because the imaginary reference to the classes, that are put on a higher level, are represented by circles, not a nonagons.

There is an idea where one related list might contain items from multiple classes. __Class A__ would have a __n à 1__ relationship to items of __Class B__ and __Class C__, which the picture below aims to express:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.008.png)

#### Counterpart out of Sight

If the counterpart of a relationship would be out of sight, a line might point out of the diagram. A catch there might be that you might not see whether the relationship counterpart would have multiplicity of __1__ or __n__. A possible solution for this, might be to express multiplicity at the end of that line that might point out of the diagram.

This might look as follows with the double dashed border notation:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.009.png)

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.010.png)

But then again, if something is out of sight, it might just be out of sight and you cannot see things out of sight. Perhaps there is no problem here.

Here are examples of what it could look like in case of relational ring notation, with explicit relationship counterparts:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.011.png)

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.012.png)

That proposal might be a problem, because it seems to clash with a proposed notation for optional. And also it seems to not reflect the containment structure: there would be a container in between the half shape and the other parts of the diagram. Seems unfortunate.

In another proposal:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.013.png)

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.014.png)

It may be going a bit far. It seems to draw out part of the diagram, that is out of sight. But then it might actually have a container in between, that is not drawn.

The argument "What is out of sight, is out of sight." might be good enough to not solve this 'problem'. A proposal might be that might not be a real problem.

Here a variation that might also be dubious:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.015.png)

In that image both relationship counterparts' class lines are connected to the same half shape. It might go a bit far in suggesting something it's not.

#### No Reuse of Merged Imaginary References

If two imaginary references have merged, to become a relationship symbol, then other references to the same classes won’t connect to an imaginary reference that has merged to become a relationship symbol. Relationships create their own imaginary references, that aren’t reused. This is displayed in the article *Relationships Between Objects in a Diagram*, but may also apply to the notation of relationships between classes.

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.016.png)

#### Example

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.017.png)

### Relations Between Objects

#### Diagram Notation

The relationship symbol is a double circle. The reason behind this notation, was already explained in the article *Relationships in a Diagram*. The notation is accomplished by first taking the original picture with one class refering to another and the other refering back to the first class:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.018.png)

Then, an imaginary reference to each class is added to the diagram

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.019.png)

Next, the class lines are merged, but also the class symbols are merged:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.020.png)

The notation would still be ambiguous, if it weren’t for the double line of the merged object symbols. So a double circle symbolizes a relationship between objects.

For relationships between classes the relationship symbol is a double *dashed* circle. For relationships between objects, the relationship symbol is a double circle drawn with *solid* lines.

#### Counterpart out of sight

When the counterpart of the relationship is out of sight, a line should point out of the diagram. A catch there is, that you can’t see if the relationship counterpart is part of a multiplicity of __n__ or not. Therefore, the multiplicity is expressed at the end of th line pointing out of the diagram as follows:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.021.png)

#### No reuse of merged imaginary references

If two imaginary references have merged, to become a relationship symbol, then other references to the same objects won’t connect to an imaginary reference that has merged to become a relationship symbol. Relationships create their own imaginary references, that aren’t reused.

Here is a relationship between two objects:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.020.png)

The two objects refer to eachother. This originally consisted of two distinct references:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.018.png)

Imaginary references were put on one level higher:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.019.png)

If other references to the same objects were also displayed in the diagram, then they would connect to the same imaginary references, put on a higher level:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.022.png)

When you merge the imaginary references to display that two references are part of a single relationship, you will not connect all 

references to the merged imaginary reference:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.023.png)

You will keep separate imaginary references for the other unidirectional relationships to the objects:

![](images/1.%20Relationships%20Construct%20Drafts.016.png)

### Bidirectional Relationship Synchronization Implementation Details

When you let one of the object references link to another object, then the link from the old counterpart to the object should be broken and a link from the new counterpart to the object should be established. The object synchronizes the old counterpart *out*, and it synchronizes the new counterpart *in*.

In the new computer language you are still able to create just a unidirectional relationship. In a programming environment you should be able to automatically turn a unidirectional relationship to a bidirectional relationship. In a programming environment you should be able to turn two already defined unidirectional relationships into a single bidirectional relationship.

So whenever a __Jar__ changes its __Lid__, the original __Lid__’s reference to the __Jar__ is annulled, and the new __Lid__ get a reference to its new __Jar__. This actually explains synchronization between __1 => 1__ related objects. Synchronization happens when assigning a related item. When assigning a related item, the related item gets a reference back to the first item.

Relationship synchronization happens when you assign a related object. When you assign __Lid . Jar__, then synchronizing the relationship, consists of, in turn, assigning __Jar . Lid__.

For every relationship type it works in a different way.

There are three relationship types:

- __1 <=> 1__
- __1 <=> n__
- __n <=> n__

But synchronization is managed separately for each end of the relationship, so synchronization is managed in the following four of ways:

- __1 => 1 synchronization__
- __1 => n synchronization__
- __n => 1 synchronization__
- __n => n synchronization__

#### Synchronization Types

There are four synchronization types:

- __1 => 1 synchronization__
- __1 => n synchronization__
- __n => 1 synchronization__
- __n => n synchronization__

Every synchronization type follows a slightly different procedure, to make sure that on assignment of one relationship counterpart, the other relationship counterpart goes along with it.

#### 1 => 1 Synchronization

__1 => 1__ synchronization is quite easy. In a __Jar =>__ __Lid__ relationship, when assigning __Lid . Jar__, The old __Jar . Lid__ is set to __Nothing__, while the new __Jar . Lid__ is set to __This__.

#### Risk of infinite loop 1 => 1

When a relationship is synchronized, you may have a risk to an infinite loop.
When you assign __Jar__ to __Lid__, then __Lid__ is assigned to __Jar__, upon which __Jar__ is assigned to __Lid__ again, and so on. Fortunately, when a __Jar__ is assigned a __Lid__ it already has, the whole assignment is not executed. So it only goes as far as: __Jar__ is assigned to __Lid__, upon which __Lid__ is assigned to __Jar__ again, upon which __Jar__ is assigned to __Lid__ again, but __Jar__ already had that __Lid__, so that assignment is never executed.

#### 1 => n Synchronization

In a __1 => n__ relationship between __Parents__ and __Children__, every time you assign a __Child__ to a __Parent__, __Child . Parent__ is overwritten. The old __Child__ is assigned __Nothing__ as the __Parent__, and the new __Child__ is assigned its new __Parent__.

Also, the original __Child__’s __ID In Parent__ is yielded over to the new __Child__. The original __Child__’s __ID In Parent__ is reset.

There used to be a misunderstanding, that one __Parent__ could reference the same __Child__ multiple times. But that idea was abolished, because when a __Parent__ relates to a __Child__ twice, the __Child__ has to relate back to the __Parent__ twice. A __Child__ can only have one __Parent__, so it can never relate back to the same __Parent__ twice. Something like that would require an __n => n__ relationship, for the __Child__ to be able to hold multiple references to the same __Parent__.

#### Risk of infinite loop 1 => n

Infinite loops for __n => 1__ synchronization the are prevented the same way as for __1 => 1__ synchronization. When you assign a __Parent__ to a __Child__, The __Child__ is added to the __Parent__, upon which the __Parent__ is again assigned to the __Child__. But the __Child__ already had that __Parent__, so the assignment is never executed. So that prevents an infinite loop there.

#### n => 1 Synchronization

In a __Child  n => 1  Parent__ relationship, when you change __Child . Parent__, the __Child__ is removed from its original __Parent__ and added to the new __Parent__. So you can never have the same __Child__ in several __Parents__.

A __Child__ can not appear multiple times in the same __Parent__, because that, in turn, should give a __Child__ multiple references back to the __Parent__, but a __Child__ holds only one reference to a __Parent__.

#### Risk of infinite loop n => 1

When a __1 => n__ relationship is synchronized, you may have a risk to an infinite loop. When you add a __Child__ to a __Parent__, then the __Parent__ is assigned to the __Child__, upon which the __Child__ is added to the __Parent__ *again*.

An earlier solution proposed for this, is that in synchronizing the relationship, you never boldly __Add__ the __Child__ to the __Parent__, but you execute a __Find Or Add__, which prevents the __Child__ from being added again, when it is already in the __Parent__’s list. This would have worked, but n => n synchronization already required a different solution, that will be more efficient for n => 1 synchronization as well.

When you assign an item to a list for synchronization purposes, no synchronization is to be executed on the other side again.

You’d have to call a special __List Item Set__ procedure, accessible only to the related class, that simply won’t synchonize back again.

#### n => n Synchronization

One *related item* in one object always creates *one related item* inside the other object.

Two items, related to eachother in an __n => n__ relationship, are always connected to eachother, by connecting two specific list positions to eachother.

In __n => n__ synchronization, __Object A__’s reference to __Object B__ will be replaced by a reference to __Object C__. When __Object B__ is removed from __Object A__’s list, then __Object A__ is also be removed from __Object B__’s list. After that, __Object A__ is added to __Object C__’s list.

An item in one list is aware of its position in the other list. That makes it easy for an item in one list, to remove itself from the other list.

#### Risk of infinite loop n => n

But when you add __Object A__ to __Object C__’s list of related items, then __Object C__ will try to add itself to __Object A__’s list of related items, upon which __Object A__ will add itself to the list of __Object C__ again. An infinite loop should be prevented here.

When synchronizing the relationship between two objects in an __n => n__ relationship, you will add a position to the list of the referrer, and next assign an item to this position.

When you assign an item to a list for synchronization purposes, no synchronization is to be executed on the other side again.

You'd have to call a special __List Item Set__ procedure, accessible only to the related class, that simply won’t synchonize back again.

Another solution opted at first, was to execute a __Find Or Add__ for synchronization, instead of executing an normal __Add__ command. That would prevent a related item from being added and added again. But then you have the problem: maybe the same item *should* be added twice to the list, because one item can relate to another item multiple times, which also requires the other item to relate back to the first item multiple times. For each reference to an item, the item must have a reference back to the referrer.

So the new option is better: you have a special __List Item Set__ procedure, possibly called by a special __Add__ procedure, used solely for relationship synchronization, that won’t synchronize *back* again.

#### The abolished multiplicity of x

Earlier I had invented a multiplicity of __x__, which is plural, but then a fixed set of items, for instance three items. But __x__ can be replaced by three separate __=> 1__ relationships. __X__ was abolished in particular, because it would cause a lot of unpredictable behavior when trying to synchronize the two relationship counterparts, especially in __n/x => n/x__ synchronization.

#### Confusions about relationship synchronization

There used to be two points at which there was confusion about the workings of relationship synchronization.

##### Confusion 1

What can be confusing is that, when a __1 => n__ relationship is synchronized, it can never be used as an __n => n__ relationship. In the relationship __Parent  1 => n  Child__, every time you add a __Child__ to a __Parent__, __Child  .  Parent__ is overwritten. When you change __Child  .  Parent__, the __Child__ is removed from its original __Parent__ and added to the new __Parent__. So you can never have the same __Child__ in several __Parents__. If you want to use multiple __Parents__, you can’t.

It is often easier to define something in __1 => n__ relationships, without thinking about it, that the backward relationship might be __=> n__ too. But when a relationship is synchronized, the system falls apart when a __1 => n__ is actually intended as __n => n__ and you’re trying to *use* it that way.

This can be misconceived as an error in the new computer language, or an inability of it, while it’s really just a wrongly defined relationship.

So then it becomes really important to define the exact relationship type of something, even when it’s more difficult.

If you do want to use the __1 => n__ relationship as an __n => n__ relationship, you should change the relationship type, but you could also choose to split the bidirectional relationship into two unsynchronized unidirectional relationships. However, you will be loosing out on functionality and loosing integrity and coherence of the system.

A system in which all relationships are bidirectional and given the correct relationship type, functions in perfect harmony and everything is logical, correct and solid.

##### Confusion 2

Synchronization could cause confusion in older versions of the computer language, where you have two bidirectional relationships to the same class, that are given the same __Item Object Name__. In that case, one relationship’s counterpart synchronizing back to the related object could affect the other relationship. By default it is not allowed to have one class __A__ being __1 =>__ related to multiple classes, in which __A__ has the same __Item Object Name__. That is only allowed if the other relationships are made unidirectional, and not bidirectional, or if *melding* is enabled. *Melding* is a topic, which makes it possible for multiple relationship classes or for instance *progressed objects* (article *Progression)*, to be referenced as a single related item, but it has to be stated explicitly that this is the intention. See the article *Melding*.

## Loose Ideas

Stereotyping relationships

Perhaps another typing can be assigned to a relation, instead of containment. For instance: *ownership* or *usage*. Perhaps a few standard ones, and it may be possible to define your own typing by specifying a String.

(Specific implementation in Creator 0.9)

The main unit in a relational structure is the *class*. There is a list of *classes*.
The classes are tied together with *relationships*. One class is tied to another.

The main object that defines a relational structure is the __Structure__ object. The __Structure__ object contains a __Classes__ collection and a __Relationships__ collection. If you want to add a class, you do that in the __Classes__ collection. If you want to add a relationship, you do that in the __Relationships__ collection.

The __Classes__ collection contains objects of class __Class__.
The __Relationships__ collection contains objects of class __Relationship__.

Every __Class__ has an __Attributes__ collection. A __Person Class__, for instance, could have a __Name Attribute__ and an __EmailAddress Attribute__ and more attributes such as __Street__, __HouseNumber__, __ZipCode__, etcetera. A __Class__ also contains a __RelatedClasses__ collection, which reflects all of the class’s related classes. You can’t add __RelatedClasses__ to this collection. You have to define relationships in the __Structure.Relationships__ collection and they will be *reflected* in the __Class.RelatedClasses__ collection. Other members of the __Class__ class are explained in other sections, covering different concepts. However, all members are briefly explained in a sub section below.

A __Relationship__ consists of two __RelationClasses__. It contains two __RelationClass__ objects that define the two classes of the relationship and how they relate to one another.

A __Relationship__ also defines whether the relationship is __Bidirectional__ or __Unidirectional__, by the __Boolean__ __Bidirectional__ member. If a __Relationship__ is __Bidirectional__, then both classes are aware of eachother and refer to one another. If a __Relationship__ is __Unidirectional__ then only __RelationClassA__ is aware of __RelationClassB__ and refers to it, but __RelationClassB__ is unaware of __RelationClassA__ and doesn’t refer to it.

Even though a __Bidirectional__ relationship would seem to make __RelationClassA__ and __RelationClassB__ equal opponents, __RelationClassB__ in many cases is the inferior one. For instance, in writing XML files, __RelationClassB__ is seen as contained in __RelationClassA__ and not the other way around. In that case *direction* of the relationship does matter. However, still in many cases __RelationClassA__ and __RelationClassB__ are technically equal opponents. When you keep in mind which __RelationClass__ is inferior and which one is superior, things like XML writing go well automatically. If you are sloppy with choosing if something is __RelationClassA__ or __RelationClassB__, you could get trouble that makes you obliged to switch the two relationship classes within the relationship, but usually you won’t notice anything going wrong. So relax, but beware.

The two __RelationClass__ objects define the relationship furtherly.

The member __Class__ of __RelationClass__ is very important to set, and it defines which class makes part of the relationship. Define the __Class__ in both __RelationClasses__ of the __Relationship__ and you’ve made a relationship between the two classes.

A very important member of a __RelationClass__ is the __AbstractNumber__. This defines whether a relationship class is __1__, __x__ or __n__. If you define the __AbstractNumber__ for both of the two relationship classes, you can for instance make a 1<=>n relationship between the two classes or a x<=>n relationship or whatever. __AbstractNumber__ is __1__ by default.

To define the quantity of x, you set __ExactNumber__. For instance, in a 
__Line n<=>2 Point__ relationship, you define for the __Point__ __RelationClass__ that its __AbstractNumber = x__ and its __ExactNumber = 2__.

Two other important members of a __RelationClass__ are __CreateObjects__ and __EnsureSubObjects__. __CreateObjects__ is by default __True__, exceptions not regarded. __CreateObjects__ says that when a new position is created within the related list, an object is instantly *created* in that position (See *Objects and Object Positions*). In many cases you want that to happen. Sometimes you don’t want objects to be created, because you’d want to assign an object to that position yourself. Then you set __CreateObjects__ to __False__. Furtherly, __EnsureObjects__ will see to it that you can’t assign __Nothing__ to the object position. It is __True__ by default, but can be set to __False__. For more information see the sections *Create Objects* and *Ensure Objects*.

And then there’s another member of __RelationClass__ that is important to mention. And that is __ListType__. __ListType__ is usually set to __NormalListType__, but can also be set to __ReferenceCountedListType__, __RegistrationListType__, __SharedListType__ or __SelectionListType__. The list then gets very special behavior. For more information see the *Specialized Lists* section. Although I don’t explain them here very thoroughly, __ListType__ does mean a lot for the general structure of the system.

You can see that inside a __RelationClass__ object, much more is defined than just the __Class__. That’s why __RelationClass__ is a separate class. Many times I will speak of a relationship class, and you shouldn’t confuse it with just a class then, because it will be defining a class as it is in the context of a relationship.

The elements as I’ve described them in this section, form the following structure of  __Classes__, __Attributes__ and __Relationships__.

```

|-- Classes
|    |
|    |-- Class ()

```

Every other concept of J Data is hung up on this main structure of __Classes__, __Attributes__ and __Relationships__.

For instace, the physical appearance in the user interface of a list defined in a __RelationClass__ with __AbstractNumber = n__, is defined inside that __RelationClass__ object. The whole appearance of a __List Control__ is defined inside a __RelationClass__. That is an example of how the user interface is defined right inside the general structure above. The same way *all* of the application’s features are defined in the context of the relational structure of __Classes__, __Attributes__ and __Relationships__.
