Object Pointer Assignment in Text Code
--------------------------------------

The textual symbol for an object reference object assignment is:

```
o=à
```

It can be pronounced ‘object is pointer to’

In an actual text code line it would look like this:

```
A  o=à  B
```

It can be pronounced ‘A object is pointer to B’.
