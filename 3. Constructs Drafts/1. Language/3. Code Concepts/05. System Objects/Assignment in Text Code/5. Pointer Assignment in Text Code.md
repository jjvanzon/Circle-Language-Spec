Pointer Assignment in Text Code
-------------------------------

An assignment is actually a combination of a Get and a Set call. Instead of using a call to an assignment command, you could also use a call to the Get and Set system commands. In object reference assignment, though, no Get is executed because an object reference is the diect source of the assignment, not its object.

B  .  Other Related Item  .  Set  (  A  )

But instead, we use an assignment call (=):

B  .  Other Related Item  .  Set  =  A

(hypothetical notation, not a real, valid notation)

When you use an assignment symbol (=), you do not have to display the words Get and Set, because it is obvious, that the right operand requires a Get and the left operand requires a Set.

(hypothetical notation, not a real, valid notation)

B  .  Other Related Item  =  A

But there is no such thing as a general assignment. The above is an object reference object assignment, that has the symbol o=à. When you use the symbol o=à, you also do not have to mention ‘.  Other Related Item’:

B  o=à  A

So that is the actual notation of an object reference assignment.

Knowing how to use Get and Set commands, instead of a single assignment call, gives you a low-level understanding of assignment. This low-level understanding is important in order to create alternative forms of assignment, as explained in the article *Alternative Assignments*.
