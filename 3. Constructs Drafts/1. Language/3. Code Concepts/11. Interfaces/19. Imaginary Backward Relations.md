## **Imaginary Backward Relations**
Sometimes when a backward relation is not stored, you want to see it anyway. Particularly you always want to see all available commands inside an object, even though an object does not physically have a reference to all the commands.

This requires backward relations that are not stored, to be shown anyway. The solution is to draw them out as imaginary backward relations. This requires recalculation whenever the view changes. But this is only done for commands and objects in modules you actively reference. The you still will not have all possible commands on the internet available inside the object, but you would not want that anyway, because then you would see a ridiculous amount of commands. You just want the ones from sites that you are aquainted with.
