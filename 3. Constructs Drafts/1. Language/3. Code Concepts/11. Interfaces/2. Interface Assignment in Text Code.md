Interface Assignment in Text Code
---------------------------------

If you must have a character symbol for a class assignment, that distinguishes it from the other assignment types, it is the following symbol:

    i=

This symbol is the identifier for interface assignment. The letter __i__ stands for *interface*.

The textual symbol for an interface pointer assignment is:

    i=->

It can be pronounced ‘interface is pointer to’.  
In an actual text code line it would look like this:

    A  i=->  B

It can be pronounced ‘A interface is pointer to B’.
