Classification of Items in a (Word) Document
--------------------------------------------

By merely classifying pieces of text in a Word document, you can turn it into a database in no time. You can easily make relations between classes in that word document too, by connecting items. Actually, it’s adding relations between items, but by relating an item of one class to an item of the other class, you’re actually making a relation between two classes. However, that adds a column or at least a lot of space to the storage of a class. Maybe it should be possible for the related item to be able to be of any class. Maybe it’s just an ℓ => *n*, where ℓ standands for little.
