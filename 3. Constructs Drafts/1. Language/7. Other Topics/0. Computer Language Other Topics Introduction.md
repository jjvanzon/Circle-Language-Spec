Computer Language
=================

Other Topics
------------

This folder contains topics regarding the new computer language, that are either boring, trivial or just too advanced and go too far for now. All in all: topics, that are not important enough to cover yet. These topics may become sub-modules in the future.

The *Computer Language Other Topics* documentation has the following sub-folders:

### Utilities

Can cover all sorts of utilities for the new computer language, such as debugging or a macro recorder or code editors. Some conceptual utilities are described, some are just named, and for some of them just a few loose ideas are given. None of the utilities were implemented in software yet.

### Optimization

Covers any kind of optimization algorithm, that might be integrated into the new computer language. For now it is not considered important to think about this.

### Old or Boring

As the name suggests, the material in this folder is considered either old or boring. As such, it might not be worth mentioning what they cover. However old or boring it is, it is still about 80 pages of material, apparently not worth reading, but apparently hard to throw away as well.
