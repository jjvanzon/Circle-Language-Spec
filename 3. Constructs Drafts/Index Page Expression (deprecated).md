Expression Construct Drafts
---------------------------

A program’s systematics are not described by text code, but text code as well as the diagram notation are a mere *expression* of systematics, stored in a binary way as interlinked objects. This folder covers the different kinds of ways you can express systematics.

The basic ideas about a diagram notation were already covered earlier at the beginning of the new computer language documentation, because it was important to quickly introduce those.

Much of the documentation in this folder is a mere throw-together of ideas or pieces of text, that came out of previous descriptions of new computer programming languages.

The *Expression* folder contains the following articles:

- ### Diagrams

    - *Expression* includes a *diagram notation* for visualizing the program code. The diagrams are also a mere expression of binary interlinked objects. Systematics, stored in a binary way as interlinked objects, can be translated to a diagram. The diagram should be fully automatically drawn out. The metrics and positioning of the shapes and lines is automatically determined. The diagram can be edited, resulting in changes to the stored binary objects.

    - The basics of the diagram notation were already covered at the beginning of the new computer language documentation. How *each concept* is expressed in a diagram is already covered in the documentation *of that* concept. This documentation folder explains everything *else* about diagram the diagram notation, such as how the shape positions of the diagram are automatically determined and how the diagram can be *colored*, to make the systematics even more clear. 

    - The articles in the *Diagrams* documentation folder are not finished. They consist mostly of texts coming out of an earlier unfinished design of the diagram notation language. The diagram notation has not been realized in software yet.

- ### Text Code

    - Traditionally, the systematics of a program are expressed by means of text code. But in the new language systematics are stored as binary interlinked objects. Text code is a mere *expression* of those binary interlinked objects. The *Text Code* sub-module makes sure, that systematics are translated to text code. The text code can be adapted, resulting in changes to the stored binary objects, rather than that the text code is literally stored.

    - The articles in the *Text Code* documentation folder are not finished. They are mostly a throw-together of ideas. The exact way the textual code is going to look is not yet determined, because it was more important to work out the language conceptually along with its diagram notation, than it was to work out the textual notation. The general idea, though, is that each language element’s textual representation is considered its *literal*, that can be read out and assigned. However large the construct, the text code that represents it is still just a literal, be it composed of the literals of its sub-constructs. This is just an idea, but it might be the way to go.

    - The working version 2.0 of the new computer language has a text code, but is very basic, for version 2.0 was kept very basic: it was just a proof of concept.
