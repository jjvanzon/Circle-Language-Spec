I am wondering if I can stop emphasizing every
symbol is a reference,
and just save that for specific diagram topics.
That will make the story a lot simpler.
I can then ignore automatic containment,
making an outer stub of a redirection, the object itself.
Crap, would that simplify the explanations.

In automatic containment, I create imaginary references,
turning all the symbols imaginarily to object references,
which they actually already were. But the outer reference is representing the
object itself.

Ignore that for other article groups. Only focus on the current one.
But actually, I have already done that in the other articles.

In that case, I should stop calling them pointers to pointers.
They are, but I should stop calling them that.

It would so much simplify the usage of the language.
If you have to consider any symbol a reference, 
then it will be totally inaccessible to children, for instance.

These contemplations have everything to do with
the implications of automatic containment.
Every symbol is a reference.
But in the original Symbol, the target of all the redirections
was the object itself.
I have to uphold that, for a better understandable language.
