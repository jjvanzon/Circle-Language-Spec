Coding Concepts Introduction
----------------------------

This documentation section covers all the coding concepts and principles of the new computer language.

Some of the principles have to be implemented inside the code base. Most of the concepts can be implemented merely as a *concept* construct, using the new computer language itself.

The following principles need to be part of the code base:

- Identifiers
- Omitted Identifier
- Objects
- Sub-Objects
- Object Reference
- Related Objects
- Values
- Multiplicity
- Value Assignment
- Object Assignment

It is important to understand, that there are *coding principles*, and there are *coding concepts*. 

Coding *principles* need to be part of the code base.  
Coding *concepts* do not.

A __Concept__ is a construct, that can be programmed within the new computer language and a *principle* is something the code base can not do without. A lot of principles can be implemented as a concept, but only *after* you have added it to the code base.

Examples of coding concepts are: classes, attributes, parameters and inheritance. So none of those need to be present in the code base. They can all be programmed using the new computer language itself.

Many of the coding concepts are just as elementary to computer programming as coding principles. Functionally, coding principles and concepts blend together. That is why coding principles and coding concepts do not have separate documentation sections.

On top of that: when developing the code base, you will determine how much can be banned out of the code base, and only programmed within the new computer language itself. As the concepts are described here functionally, it is not as important to determine which ones have to be part of the code base and which ones can be left out.

### Ideas

*The texts below are loose ideas, yet to be turned into good documentation.*

Process Control,

Process Control like main processes and sub processes and the logging of user actions and stopping other processes from running if one process is in error state and a process monitor and notifications when something goes wrong...   
This should be part of Coding Concepts. I am not sure how yet.
