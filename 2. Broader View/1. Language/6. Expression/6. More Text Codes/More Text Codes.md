## **More Text Codes**

*More Text Codes* actually encapsulates a large number of sub-modules. It wraps together everything regarding other text codes. They are wrapped together, to not overshadow the other sub-modules of *Code*.

The *More Text Codes* documentation folder is genuinely a throw-together of ideas, put into a structure. It needs a lot of work to become good documentation yet.

*More Text Codes* has the following sub-folders:

### *Additional Text Codes*

*Additional Text Codes* covers two more types of text codes, that are so important inside the new computer language, that they are not considered legacy codes, but additional codes: *Math Code* and *Assembly*.

No articles have been written about them yet. No version of the new computer language has intrinsically supported math syntax or assembly operations yet.

### *Legacy Text Codes*

*Legacy Text Codes* covers text codes non-standard to the new computer language. The new computer language has its own text code syntax + math syntax and assembly language syntax. But other types of text code may be supported as legacy text codes. Each legacy text code has a separate module. Here is a list of text codes, that might be supported. More languages may be added in the future, but there may also be languages in the list, that will never be supported at all:

*XML*

*SQL*

*Visual Basic*

*C++*

*C*

*HTML*

*Javascript*

*VB Script*

*Basic*

*Cobol*

*Fortran*

*...*

Hardly any documentation has been written about legacy text codes yet. No legacy text code modules have been implemented in any of the version of the new computer language yet.

### *Parser*

To translate typed in text code to interlinked binary objects there will be a generally reusable *Parser* module, that can be set up to parse any text code language. *Parser* is the base module for each supported text code. The syntax of a language can be defined and then *Parser* should be able to parse that type of text code.

This documentation folder has documents, that are no more than an unoverviewable throw-together of ideas. Attempts to make a generally reusable parser were made, but the first attempt failed, because it had the wrong approach and the second attempt was simply never finished.

### *Text Templates*

Some computer programs can benefit from having standard texts with placeholders inside of them, that could be replaced by an arbitrary value. As such you have pieces of text, that are templates for other pieces of texts. You have to fill in the blanks in those templates. This concept is used by a lot of software. The *Text Templates* module facilitates in this type of functionality.

The documents in this folder only describe the idea. They are not fully worked out and the idea has also not been implemented in any of the software yet.

### *Text Operations*

*Text Operations* has commands that operate on what is also called *strings* in the programming world. Strings have always required a set of operations you can execute, for instance to take the left part of a text, the right part, or a part in the middle, to replace a text inside another text, to find a text inside another text, to check whether the text starts with a certain other text, etcetera. All those text operations are covered by the *Text Operations* module.

There is hardly any documentation about it yet. Several *Text Operations* modules have been implemented in the software.

### *Text Validation*

When a user enters a text into a text box, he or she might make an error. Before the entered text is actually stored inside an object, there should first be checked if the entered text is valid. For instance, when you are supposed to type in a number, and instead you type in a letter, this is not valid. To facilitate such input validation, there is the *Text Validation* module.

This documentation folder is completely empty. An attempt was made around the year 2000 to create a text validation module, but it was never completed and it was hardly ever used.
