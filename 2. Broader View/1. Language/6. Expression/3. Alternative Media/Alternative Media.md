Computer Language Expression
============================

Consider the different types of literals in Text Code. You can use this literal type subdivision for alternative media too. But the thing is: each concept could get its own type of literal again. Yes, but there are also a few basic ones, the expression of which could facilitate in the expression of anything.

### **Langauge Integration**

< Chemistry language. Flat or 3D>

< controls are an interactive language>

< an interactive language is a language that doesn’t only allow expression of things, but allows at least two parties to exchange information and respond to given information. > 

You can translate parts of a system to text, but you can just as well translate it to a more graphical language. 

The Information Language, part of the J Data technology, is a diagram language designed to define information ( / data ) structures. It is a form of diagram different from Symbol.

#### **Real Language**

If X Then A

If X is true then A will be executed.

`	`Select X

`		`Case 0: A

`		`Case 1: B

`	`End Select

When X = 0, A is executed

When Y = 1 then A is executed

Maybe I should allow the ‘real language’ text to be used as code too. Eventually.

#### **Brainstorm**

How about … an alternative notation for an object structure… like a simple tree notation.

How about integrating VB and C++?

#### **Other notations**

##### ***Dimensional Table notation***

|**Object Genericity**|
| :- |
||**Object**|
|||Original object|<p>Object determined by no line</p><p>(no object line)</p>|
|||Delegated object|<p>Object determined by a line</p><p>(object line)</p>|
||**Type**|
|||Original type|<p>Type determined by no line</p><p>(object nor type line)</p>|
|||Delegated type|<p>Type determined by a line</p><p>(type or object line)</p>|
|||Explicit type|<p>Type determined by type line</p><p>(limits the possible object to objects of that type)</p>|
|||Generic type|<p>Type determined by object line</p><p>(symbol adopts any type the object might have) </p>|
||**Interface**|
|||Original interface|<p>Interface determined by no line</p><p>(interface, type nor object line)</p>|
|||Delegated interface|<p>Interface determined by a line</p><p>(interface, type or object line)</p>|
|||Explicit interface|<p>Interface determined by interface line</p><p>(one specific interface of the type is used)</p><p>(limits the possible types to ones that support the interface)</p>|
|||Generic interface|<p>Interface determined by type line or object line</p><p>(type’s whole interface used)</p><p>(symbol adopts any interface the type might have)</p>|
|**Procedure Genericity**|
||**Definition**|
|||Original definition|<p>Definition determined by no line</p><p>(no reference line)</p>|
|||Delegated definition|<p>Definition determined by a line</p><p>(a reference line)</p>|
||**Interface**|
|||Original interface|<p>Interface determined by no line</p><p>(interface nor reference line)</p>|
|||Delegated interface|<p>Interface determined by a line</p><p>(interface or reference line)</p>|
|||Explicit interface|<p>Interface determined by interface line</p><p>(limits the possible procedure to procedures with that interface)</p>|
|||Generic interface|<p>Interface determined by reference line</p><p>(symbol adopts any interface the procedure might have)</p>|
|**Interface Doesn’t Determine Type**|
||Interface-type genericity|The fact that the interface never fixes the type|
||Interface-procedure genericity|The fact that the procedure interface never fixes the  procedure.|

##### ***Tree Notation***

You know the kind

But my kind also has convergence… and allows 1/nà1/n distinction or maybe those are other notations yet.

## **Brainstorm**

Operators:

J Data Information Language is an alternative notation used inside Symbol code. Does it therefore consist of operator functions? And is that then the first operator that is about a more non textual notation a a more graphical one?

# ***Other ideas***

Text, diagram, algebra, data.

Literals in alternative media


Also: tree view

controls are alternative media.

So control concepts are basically an alternative expression media

in which to express code and data,

just like the diagrams or text code are a media in which to express

the code and data.

#### **Information Language**

You can express the final database structure in Symbol code and in information language ‘dialects’. Actually it’s no more than a notational choice. Symbol works as a base for information language. Information Language is sort of Symbol with an arrow notation and without multiple encapsulation levels. Information Language as I (part) defined it, totally flattens out the object structure. It hands ideas about flattening out object structure, though.

Ja, het begint zich een beetje in elkaar te schuiven. Information is niet meer dan een Symbol dialect, met een speciale toepassing. Als je in Symbol een flat object, arrow notatie invoert dan heb je information language al bijna. Hmmm… interessant.



Tree like diagram with convergences should be part of Symbol I guess.


Maybe by giving symbol aspects to it, I can refine the tree like diagram language
