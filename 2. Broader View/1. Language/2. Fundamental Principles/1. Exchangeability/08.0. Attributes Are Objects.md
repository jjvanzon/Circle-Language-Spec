Attributes Are Objects
======================

__Attributes__ may very well become __Classes__ in the future. __Classes__ will eventually be capable of being configured to behave just like simple variables.

A __Class__ looks exactly like a simple data type when it has the following configuration:

- Exclusive =>1 relation with the parent
- Containment relation with the parent
- Literal
- Never a pointer, always the object itself
- Always created
- No relations to other objects
- Binary data can be written and read from anywhere

A __Class__ is no longer generally considered an __Attribute__ type when:

- No exclusive =>1 relation with the parent
- No containment relation with the parent
- It has relations to other objects

If the other aspects are missing, then it could still be generally considered an __Attribute__.

__Attributes__ will cease to exist as we know them, and will become __Classes__. The __Class__ they are an __Attribute__ of, will have an exclusive 1=>1 relation with the __Attribute__, the __Attribute__ is always created and that is never assigned another object reference, but its members can be called and a literal value can be assigned and returned, and (most of the times) the binary contents can be used. And there won’t even be attribute types anymore!

C++ will allow an object to perfectly mimic a variable, so that’s really nice.

You should still be able to see a __Relation Class__ as an __Attribute__. An __IsAttribute Boolean__ in the __Relation Class__ will do. You should also maintain an automatic filter index named __Attributes__, which will give the class an __Attributes__ collection.

__Attributes__ are still very much an application design concept. The only technical remainder in J Data will be that there is a __Class Preset__ called __Attribute__, which gives the __Class__ settings as they are generally expected in an __Attribute__. For more information, see the *Presets* section. The __Attributes__ filter index can also be automatically created by setting the __Class__’s __HasAttributes__ property.

You should also be able to add things to the __Attributes__ collection of the __Class__, or you’d have to define everything in the __Structure.Relation__ collection. Heck, I want to be able to add relations to the __Class.RelatedClasses__ anyway. I could just make __Class.RelatedClasses.Add__ create a __Relation__ in the Structure.Relations collection and return the __Other Relation Class__. When adding to the __Attributes__ collection, I should do the same, but give the added __Relation Class__ the __Attribute Preset__.

To be able to use value filters, you have to be able to filter by an object’s literal value. That should be considered in the *Filters, Sorts, Searches, Joins and Indexes* section too.

It still must be possible to give attributes parameters. That implies that =>1 related objects can get parameters.

###### Other Things

Simple data types could be replaced by J Math objects. In that case some of the rules for mimicking attributes, will get ignored. The worst one that is ignored is that J Math objects can have relations to other classes. In that case, the binary contents of the object isn’t just the value of the variable anymore, it also contains all sorts of stuff for the related classes, such as __IDs__ for instance.

Attributes can be considered are outermost nodes of the relational structure, the other nodes are intemediate nodes. This phrase is true most of the times, but attributes aren’t bound that tightly to the rules I’ve set out above anymore. You can better say: objects with no relations to other objects are the outermost nodes of the relational structure. Actually: pieces of binary data (target data, not pointers) are outer nodes.

##### Attributes Become Classes

Eerder dacht ik ook aan om misschien meteen Attributes Become Classes toe te passen. Maar laat dat nog maar even. Het inrichten van attributen is heel erg gelijk aan het inrichten van related items. Je zou de item class ook 1 string waarde kunnen geven, 1 integer waarde, etcetera. Daarmee kan de item class ook een enkele string of integer representeren.

Toen ik dit probeerde te implementeren in de eerste opzet van Creator 2.0, kreeg ik problemen met de verschillen tussen een object referentie en een uniek object, enzo. Het was in ieder geval erg lastig om het meteen te implementeren, dus ik heb gewoon Attributes apart gedaan.

## Ideas

###### Attributes Are Objects

Het concept Create Objects kan trouwens enigszins gezien worden als identiek aan het Default Value concept. (maar de twee concepten kunnen alleen mergen als Attributes are

Classes)

Het Ensure Objects concept kan zo ook gezien worden als identiek aan het Not Null concept.
