## **Protocols**
*Protocols* will enable several internet protocols, so that you can access resources that are exposed through those protocols. Protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP, etcetera. *Protocols* will make sure a *Software System* resource is accessible through those protocols. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet and the list of protocols is not finished.
