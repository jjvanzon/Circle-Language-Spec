Text Codes
----------

*Text Codes* covers text codes non-standard to the new computer language. The new computer language has its own text code syntax + math syntax and assembly language syntax. But other types of text code may be supported as legacy text codes. Each text code has a separate module. Here is a list of text codes, that might be supported. More languages may be added in the future, but there may also be languages in the list, that will never be supported at all. Each text code has its own folder, but hardly any documentation has been written about text codes yet. No text code modules have been implemented in any of the version of the new computer language yet either. Here are the projected text codes:

- *XML*
- *SQL*
- *Visual Basic*
- *C++*
- *C*
- *HTML*
- *Javascript*
- *VB Script*
- *Basic*
- *Cobol*
- *Fortran*
- *...*
