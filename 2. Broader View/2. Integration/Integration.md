Circle Broader View
==================


Integration
-----------

This folder does not contain a lot of documentation. It is the bone-structure for future documentation. Also, hardly any integration software has been developed yet. This folder will contain any documentation about integration modules, that *Circle* has to offer in order to integrate with the rest of the world of computer technology. *Circle* is not meant to live on its own, but existing resources on the internet should be accessible, when working with the new language. Each integration module will facilitate two goals: accessing other systems using *Circle* and the ability to access *Circle* resources from inside other systems. As such you can access other file systems using *Circle*, and you can also access *Circle* resources as if it was a file system. That example would be called *File System Integration*. As such there will be systems such as *Database Integration*, *SOAP Integration*, *ODBC Integration*, *File Types* and *Module System Integration*. It is considered quite important, that *Circle* in the future will give access to all those resources as well as be accessible by other systems through all kinds of different protocols.

There are the following sub-folders:

### File System Integration

You can access other file systems from within *Circle*, and you can also access *Circle* as if it *were* a file system. *File System Integration* also covers any other tools regarding files. In the new software system you would apply those to *objects* instead of files. Some file tools have been developed. The documentation folder only contains loose ideas about file functions.

### Database Integration

*Database Integration* will allow you to access *Circle* as if it were a relational database, but will also allow you to access relational database systems from within *Circle*. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### SOAP Integration

*SOAP Integration* will expose *Circle* resources through a SOAP interface, but also allow you to access other SOAP interfaces using *Circle*. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### ODBC Integration

*ODBC Integration* will make *Circle* support connecting to it through ODBC, but will also allow you to access other relational database resources using ODBC from within Circle. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### File Types

*File Types* will allow you to export or expose *Circle* resources as different commonly used file types, but also allows you to access files of such types from within *Circle*. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### Module System Integration

*Module System Integration* means, that you could for instance use ActiveX resources, Java, COM, .NET and other module systems using *Circle*. Also, *Circle* resources could linked to as if they were for instance COM or any other module systems. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### Protocols

Also, there will be *Protocols*, which will enable several internet protocols, so that you can access resources that are exposed through those protocols. Protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP, etcetera. *Protocols* will make sure a *Circle* resource is accessible through those protocols. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### Legacy API's

Furthermore, a lot of software is dependent on API’s. When software is made, and it uses an API, it is dependent on that API. You can not port the software to another system if the same API is not supported. *Module System Integration* might part solve this. You can link to resources from other systems, so you do not necessarily need to port to native *Circle* to integrate with another system. However, you might want to be able to port your system to the new computer language’s native operating system, to make use of new features in it. Porting as such is only possible if the API your program depends on, is either accessible through *Module Systems Integration* or the legacy API is supported in the new computer language as well. That is the part *Legacy API’s* is responsible for. It is undoable to support all existing API’s inside the new *OS*, but if an API is supported, *Legacy API’s* is the part of the system to put it in. The documentation folder is empty. No software has been developed for this yet.

### ‘…’

Perhaps later other types of systems to integrate with will come to light. That is why this folder is put at the end: as a placeholder for possible future folders.


Ideas
------

*The texts below are loose ideas, yet to be turned into good documentation.*

The integration with other systems and protocols, file systems, network protocols, formats… etcetera.

Ideas


standaarden ondersteunen is een belangrijk punt,

maar niet voor de fase waar ik nu in zit.

Dat zou onderdeel van J Integration worden,

omdat als je binnen m'n systeem blijft werken,

deze modules eigenlijk niet nodig zijn,

maar om met de rest van de wereld samen te

werken wel.

En J Integration zal (als soort protest) misschien wel de meeste modules bevatten. Daarin zit dan de boodschap: J Integration zou eigenlijk niet nodig zijn, maar de wereld zoals die nu is zorgt er wel even voor dat het aantal nodige modules met 92% wordt vermeerderd, terwijl ze functioneel eigenlijk niets toevoegen. J Integration zou worden gezien als modules die functioneel niets toevoegen, maar alleen verzorgen dat op oude zooi wordt aangesloten. Desalnietemin, is m'n eigen zooi niet commercieel viable, zonder J Integration. Er zijn gewoon dingen, die ik vroeger als totaal onbelangrijk zag, waar m'n systeem in de toekomst keihard op stuk zou lopen.

Gewoon vanuit commercieel oogpunt.

Meer bestandsformaten aankunnen door apart pulg-in-bare conversie modules, die een bestandsformaat converteren van en naar het hoofdbestandsformaat. Je moet functionaliteit kunnen uitschakelen afhankelijk van het bestandsformaat. Je kunt daarbij de functies uitschakelen, of een waarschuwing geven.

It's compatibility that might be shit in my operating system. I should not build around other people's documents. I should include porting a document to the operating system, not to work with other people's documents. And, heh heh heh heh, not be able to port it back... maybe.


I think it's legal to work with Word and Excel files.

maybe others too

### Commercially Sellable Due to Integration Modules

I also strive to integrate with other systems more, just because the internet already provides such a rich set of applications, that I would be happy to have them immediately available under my operating system.

The integration modules make my system more easy to promote, even to myself. Because it instantly extends my system with the richness of what’s available on the internet. It makes it easier for other companies to start working with the operating system as a view on the world, to extend their existing systems with, and to make new systems in.

There are only a couple of main technologies you’d have to integrate with, these days. This is mainly due to the development of the internet. No longer do you have to integrate with any operating system API, or any network technology. Integrate with a few internet technologies and you’ve covered 99.9 percent of it. The ones you don’t integrate with *then*, don’t integrate with the internet, and that makes *them* doomed to fail. Just as much as my own system is doomed to fail, if it doesn’t integrate with the rest of the internet. The internet has become a beautiful thing in the past couple of years.


Integration,



E-mail Integration.

Do I have plans to integrate with e-mail systems?
