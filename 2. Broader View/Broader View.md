## **Circle Language**
This is the first group of products for the new computer language. This group of products is currently being developed. This product will have great use in software development today.

This folder only contains the part that would fall under the category of framework components related to Circle language.

The new language is actually a new way to operate computers. Using the language you can connect to several systems. The main aim now is for it to become usable within .NET.

It is subdivided into the following three parts:

### *Language*

This is the most important part of the documentation. It covers everything about coding concepts, including a diagram notation for visualizing program code and the fundamental principles of a new computer programming language. It contains explanations on how coding concepts are implemented in the new computer programming language: coding concepts such as objects, classes, relations, interfaces, input output, commands and parameters. Several experimental versions of a new computer programming language have been developed, but not yet the final one.

### *Integration*

This folder does not contain a lot of documentation. It is the bone-structure for future documentation. Also, hardly any integration software has been developed yet. This folder will contain any documentation about integration modules, that *Circle* has to offer in order to integrate with the rest of the world of computer technology. *Circle* is not meant to live on its own, but existing resources on the internet should be accessible, when working with the new language. Each integration module will facilitate two goals: accessing other systems using *Circle* and the ability to access *Circle* resources from inside other systems. As such you can access other file systems using *Circle*, and you can also access *Circle* resources as if it was a file system. That example would be called *File System Integration*. As such there will be systems such as *Database Integration*, *SOAP Integration*, *ODBC Integration*, *File Types* and *Module System Integration*. *Database Integration* will allow you to access *Circle* as if it were relational database, but will also allow you to access relational database systems using *Circle*. *SOAP Integration* will expose *Circle* resources through a SOAP interface, but also allow you to access other SOAP interfaces using *Circle*. *ODBC Integration* will make *Circle* support connecting to it through ODBC, but will also allow you to access relational database resources using ODBC inside *Circle*. *File Types* will allow you to export or expose *Circle* resources as different commonly used file types, but also allows you to access files of such types from within *Circle*. *Module System Integration* means, that you could for instance use ActiveX resources, Java, COM, .NET and other module systems using *Circle*. Also, *Circle* resources could be linked to as if they were for instance COM or any other module systems. Also, there will be *Protocols*, which will enable several internet protocols, so that you can access resources that are exposed through those protocols using Circle. Protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP, etcetera. It is considered quite important, that *Circle* in the future will give access to all those resources as well as be accessible by other systems through all kinds of different protocols.

### *Libraries*

This folder is to contain documentation about some basic libraries needed for the new computer language to run more or less autonomously. It should cover libraries for basic math operations and assembly language, or machine instructions.

Most documentation is not written yet. The development version of the *Basic Math* documentation is fairly readable and covers implementations of basic math, which are *object*-systems in which numbers and math operation are objects, that link together (called *Math Objects*). *Math Objects* versions were programmed using version 0.9 and 2.0 of the new computer programming language.


These things are enough to make the *Circle* language useful for accessing many computer systems.
