Clear Cut Coding Principles
---------------------------

The idea behind clear cut coding principles, is that the computer language is so accessible, that even children could pick it up, because the principles are so easy to understand, and there are not that many pitfalls.  
But I think only part of this is true. I think the basic parts of the coding principles can be taught to children, enough for them to create something useful with it, but more advanced subjects need to be left out, because not all of it can be understood that easily.

I think the following topics could be picked up even by children:

- Objects
- Relations
- Multiplicity
- Attributes
- Methods
- Input & Output

But not things like:

- Concepts
- Type Safety
- Locking

But some advanced features can be turned on, without your being conscious of how it exactly works. For instance: automatic containment can be applied automatically, but you don’t need to know exactly how it works.

Computer Language 0.9 was less clear cut, because it allowed you to add any kind of custom text code to any of the classes or modules, whenever the generated code would not suffice. In Computer Language 2.0 and 3.0 you won’t be able to do that. You are compelled to declaring any variable or object as an attribute or a relation. That will make a program defined in a clearer way.
