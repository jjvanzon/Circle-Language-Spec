Classes Implementation

### Texts to Incorporate

The Class concept adds more New and Annul system commands, than just the New and Annul of a related item.

Class's Implementation as an Aspect,  
2008-06-10

A class adds a sub object to the system interface,  
a procedure on object assignment of this sub object,  
which configures the object that gets the class.  
It will also change the diagram expression module.
