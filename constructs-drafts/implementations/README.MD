Circle Language Broader View | Implementations
==============================================

Overview
--------

`[ Out of Scope ]`

Topics in this folder may have been left out of the spec, because of a decision not to cover *implementations* and applications of the diagram notation. Internal workings may not be that essential for conveying the ideas about this diagram language.

Here might be some of the topics that could  be found here:

- ### [Achievability](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/achievability)

    - This sub-folder represents a category of principles that might be called the *achievability principles*. The achievability principles would be a set of principles, that describe how a new computer language might be developed in a limited amount of time with a limited amount of people: what techniques might be employed to make that possible.

- ### [Classes Implementation | Texts to Incorporate](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/classes-implementation-texts-to-incorporate.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, about making an application in which the concept is used, rather than belonging in the specification of the language.

- ### [Code Editor | Not Written Yet](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/code-editor-not-written-yet.md)

    - This document may not have been written yet. On top of text code being constructed and parsed, text code may also separately require a code editor for use in the programming environment.

- ### [Commands Implementation](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/commands-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, about making an application in which the concept is used, rather than belonging in the specification of the language.

- ### [Optimization](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/optimization.md)

    - Covers any kind of optimization algorithm, that might be integrated into the new computer language. For now this is considered not too important to think about.

- ### [Referrers Implementation](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/referrers-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, about making an application in which the concept is used, rather than belonging in the specification of the language.

- ### [System Commands Implementation](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/system-commands-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, about making an application in which the concept is used, rather than belonging in the specification of the language.
