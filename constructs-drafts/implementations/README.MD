Circle Language Construct Drafts | Implementations
==================================================

Overview
--------

`[ Out of Scope ]`

Topics in this folder may have been left out of the spec, because of a decision not to cover *implementations* and applications of the diagram notation. Internal workings may not be that essential for conveying the ideas about this diagram language.

Here might be some of the topics that could  be found here:

- ### [Achievability](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/achievability)

    - The achievability principles would be a set of principles, that describe how a running new computer language might be developed in a limited amount of time with a limited amount of people: what techniques might be employed to try and make that possible.

- ### [Classes Implementation | Texts to Incorporate](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/classes-implementation-texts-to-incorporate.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the specification of the language, but are more an application of it.

- ### [Code Editor | Not Written Yet](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/code-editor-not-written-yet.md)

    - This document may not have been written yet. On top of text code being constructed and parsed, text code may also separately require a code editor for use in the programming environment.

- ### [Commands Implementation](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/commands-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the specification of the language, but are more an application of it.

- ### [Optimization](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/optimization.md)

    - Covers any kind of optimization algorithm, that might be integrated into the new computer language. For now this is considered not too important to think about.

- ### [Referrers Implementation](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/referrers-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the specification of the language, but are more an application of it.

- ### [System Commands Implementation](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/implementations/system-commands-implementation.md)

    - Ideas about this topic, that might not belong in the specification of the language, but are more an application of it.
