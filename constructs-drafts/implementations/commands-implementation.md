Commands Implementation
-----------------------

`[ Out of Scope ]`

The behavior, that turns an object into an executable command, is implemented as the __Command__ concept. When an object supports the __Command__ concept, it automatically becomes a command. The code base only needs to support an object’s ability to execute in some basic form. But most of the functionality for commands is programmed within the new computer language itself. The code base only supplies the very minimum basic need to facilitate it.
