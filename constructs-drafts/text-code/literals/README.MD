Literals
--------

The general idea is that each language element’s textual representation is considered the language element’s *literal*, that can be read out and assigned. However large the construct, its text code is still just a literal, be it composed of the literals of its sub-constructs.

The main article in this folder only contains an explanation of the traditional meaning of literals, and also some loose ideas about the topic of literals. There are the following sub-folders:

- ### Object Literals

    - This article was not written yet, but should contain the explanation how objects can get literals. Simple objects, like numbers and dates, should be covered, but also how a literal can be assigned to an object to initialize the object’s members.

- ### Command Literals

    - The text code of command definitions and command calls are also considered literals. This article is not finished yet, but it should contain a description of how command definitions and command calls are translated to literals.

- ### Concept Literals

    - This article is not finished, but it should describe how the *concept* programming construct should be able to define new literal notations. Some programming constructs are programmed using the new computer language itself. So as you do that, you also should include a textual notation of those new constructs. So you should be able to custom-define textual notations for newly introduced constructs.

- ### Collection Operation Literals

    - Notations for *collections* should also have literals: from simple array access, to a notation to execute a command on all the items inside a collection at once.
