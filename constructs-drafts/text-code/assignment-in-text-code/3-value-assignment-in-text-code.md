Value Assignment in Text Code
-----------------------------

`[ Deprecated documentation ]`

If you must have a character symbol for a value assignment, that distinguishes it from the other assignment types, it is the following symbol:

```
v=
```

This symbol is the identifier for value assignment. The letter __v__ stands for value.
