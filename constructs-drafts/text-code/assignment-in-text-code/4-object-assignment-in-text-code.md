Object Assignment in Text Code
------------------------------

`[ Deprecated documentation ]`

If you must have a character symbol for an object assignment, that distinguishes it from the other assignment types, it is the following symbol:

```
o=
```

This symbol is the identifier for object assignment. The letter __o__ stands for *object*.
