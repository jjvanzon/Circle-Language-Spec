Class Pointer Assignment in Text Code
-------------------------------------

`[ Deprecated documentation ]`

The textual symbol for an object reference class assignment is:

```
c=->
```

It can be pronounced ‘class is pointer to’.

In an actual text code line it would look like this:

```
A  c=->  B
```

It can be pronounced ‘A class is pointer to B’.
