Input Output,  
2008-10-15

In the new computer language you will see, which things have a reference to which other things. So when you have an element of the system, you immediately which parts of the system use the element. But when you are working on a development version of something, you might have definitions to which no input or output targets are assigned yet. In that case it is handy to have an example of what the input or output might look like. This is not the same as a default value. It is an example value. In a real business environment it might become a convention, that the example input parameters establish a call upon mere test data. And when a test command is run, the example output can indicate whether anything has changed to the output since then.

I keep speaking in terms of input and output, so why can parameters not be typed as input output yet in the Parameters documentation. That's why Input Output should be exactly defined in the Input Output documentation. It is very important to have a clear view on the exact definition of when something is input and when something is output.

Data Direction,

To abstractly express data direction unspecific of what specific data, I  used a double wavy line, but I like a triple wavy line better. Triple better expresses a multitude, then just two.

Save this idea for Input / Output, because that is where it starts to publicly matter what happens privately.

In the C++ programming language constant parameters can be set at run time when you call a procedure. In Symbol constants are really constant: they will not change at run time and are only set at design time
