`<< nice formulation >>`  
Also executes, when its parent command executes,

`<< details >>`  
but it doesn’t delegate to another command, like a call might:

`<< terminology >>`  

It is an undelegated part of a command, called a *clause*.

`<< synonyms >>`  
Because a diamond might not be a call, it is also called an *execution* or an *execution point*.

`<< terminology >>`  
An undelegated square inside a command is also considered a clause.

but it doesn’t execute, unless you call it.

A lineless diamond is also called an *active clause*, while a lineless square is also called an *inactive clause*.
