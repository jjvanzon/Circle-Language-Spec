==================================

From Spec
---------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

Topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then maybe lesser worked out ideas about these topic.

- [Black Boxes Construct Drafts](black-boxes-construct-drafts)

    - Lesser worked out ideas about this topic.

- [Basic Diagram Elements Construct Drafts](basic-diagram-elements-construct-drafts.md)

    - Lesser worked out ideas about this topic.

- [Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled](commands-and-classes-loosely-coupled.md)

    - Objects of the same class might have a similar set of commands. But one particular idea for commands would be, that they might live as separate entities, not part of a specific class. The general idea would then be, that a command would automatically be available inside a class, if one of its parameters matches with that class.

    - This idea is let go of for now, because it seemed optional and hard to match with other ideas like encapsulation and containment structure.

- [Relationships Construct Drafts](relationships-construct-drafts.md)

    - Lesser worked out ideas about this topic.

- [System Command Call Notations Construct Drafts](system-command-call-notations-construct-drafts.md)

    - There might be several notations for calling a system command, like __Get__, __Set__ and __Use__ commands. The were the deprecated notation proposals.
