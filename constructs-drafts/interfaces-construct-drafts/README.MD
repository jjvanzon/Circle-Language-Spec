Lesser worked out ideas about this topic may be moved here from the spec.

- ### Extensive Classification with Interfaces
    
    - Extensive classification with interfaces might encompass some ideas about how to use interface more where otherwise you might not, so that a more detailed classification of things might emerge. This might be interesting to form some sort of semantic model. Mutuality of commands automatically leading to mutuality of interfaces might be a simpler example of an application of such an idea. Or a grouping based on what a dependent object uses. The idea might be played with but might not be fully worked out.

- ### Imaginary Backward Relationships
    
    - Some relationships between objects are bidirectional. Some are not. Imaginary backward relationships might be the idea that even when a relationship is not defined as bidirectional, you might derive the backwards relationship on the fly in certain cases, because it might be useful information. Producing the backward relationship may involve scanning part of a system in which an object might be used or perhaps sped up by some sort of caching scheme.

- ### Mutual Commands, Mutual Interfaces
    
    - Perhaps multiple objects have commands that looks similar on the outside. Even without defining an interface yourself, some sort of mechanism or construct might be thought of that might make you able to reference any object that has a command much like it.

    - Or when multiple objects have a sub-object with the same class, you might reference them as having a mutual type, even when you have not necessarily defined this type yourself.
