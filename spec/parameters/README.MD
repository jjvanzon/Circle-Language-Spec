    - This take on *Parameters* might once take preference over the one currently in the *Spec*. The *Spec* may currently speak of parameters as a loosely coupled relationship between commands and classes. That take on it might have made things rather complicated instead of being more helpful. The take here in *Construct Drafts* seemed simpler and perhaps a more usable alternative. It seems to talk about subdividing parameter passings into __By Ref / By Value__ and __Input / Output / Thruput__. The idea seems to have been set aside, because of some difficulty defining what __Input__ and __Output__ mean precisely on a more detailed level as well as in grander scope. But a simplified version of this story it might be more helpful as a way to express parameters in this diagram language, that may once become part of the *Spec* again.
