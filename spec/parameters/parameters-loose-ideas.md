### Parameter and Argument

*(From the original Symbol documentation)*

Parameters and arguments are the *public* members of a procedure. In a square they’re called parameters. In a diamond they’re called arguments.

A parameter is never created. An argument is an object that exists when the diamond executes. Therefore, an argument is a real created object, while a parameter is only a blue-print for it.

A parameter is a public member of a definition.
An argument is a public member of a diamond in execution.

#### Brainstorm

##### Other

Creation and state read and write only apply to object parameters, not to parameters that are procedures.

### Public Inactive Clause `=` Command `Out` Parameter

`<< parameters >>`
But *inactive* clauses might be referenced and made public. If `you make` an inactive clause public, `you might` make it an __Object Out__ parameter: an object `produced or determined` by `the` command. A public inactive clause `might` be a command definition `produced` by another command.

### Misc Ideas

Commands,  
± 2008

The idea of multi-methods and exchangeability between class methods and method parameters is the expressed in textual pseudo-code below:

Nice phrase? "how to link objects to a command."

Clauses might have parameters, `just like` command definitions:
