Translating To and From Relational Database
-------------------------------------------

`[ Deprecated documentation ]`

This may be a module to convert a relational database to a structure inside Encircle computer language or to convert a structure in the Encircle computer language to a relational database. The idea came out of the design of the relational language *Creator* made in 2007. The idea was, that this would make using the new language an option more easily picked.

A relational database can be built of the relational structure. In that case it should create abilities as it gets queried. It could also search source code for SQL queries and translate them to abilities. That way you’d make starting to use J Data an option easier picked.
