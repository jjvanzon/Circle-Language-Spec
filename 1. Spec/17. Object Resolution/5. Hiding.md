\- Accessing a hidden name


2004,

If there are multiple procedures and variables with the same name, Visual Basic takes the value of the more local variable, which in this case, is the Form1 variable.

\-

References to the name Temp within the procedure would access the local variable; references to Temp outside the procedure would access the public variable. The module-level variable can be accessed from within the procedure by qualifying the variable with the module name
