express mutuality of object
separate from expressing relations...
So you have a relation symbol function
as the indicator of a relation,
and an imaginary reference functioning
as the indicator of the object.
Too many lines.
It sucks.

Perhaps I need to show the symbol's contents
only at the highest containment level,
at which the object is referenced.
And therefore, have relation symbols
also only reside on a high level.

But is there a situation in which you
access things on a deeper level?
Or is everything happening, elevated
to a higher level, by putting imaginary references
on a higher level.

It still does not look good

Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in
- Containment implies a relation back to the parent
- Relations are given direction
- Most relations have a main direction,
  the main direction is displayed as a unary relation
  but with a couple of circles around the line,
  indicating a dual relation.
