Commands Broader View Articles
------------------------------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

Command-related topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then ideas perhaps more philosophical and lesser to the point.

- [Commands | Broader View](commands-broader-view.md)

    - Miscellaneous ideas that might fall under the umbrella of broader view on the concept of Commands.

- [Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled](commands-and-classes-loosely-coupled.md)

    - Objects of the same class might have a similar set of commands. But one particular idea for commands might be, that they might live as separate entities, not part of a specific class. The general idea might then be, that a command might automatically be available inside a class, if one of its parameters matches with that class.

    - This idea is let go of for now, because it seemed optional and hard to match with other ideas like encapsulation and containment structure.

- [Commands Compared to Objects](commands-compared-to-objects.md)

    - Notation for commands may differ from that of objects, mainly by usage of different shapes. The similarity in notations may lead to questions like: "Are commands just like objects? In what way might they be different?" This article tries to explore different ways commands may compare to objects.
