================================

From Spec

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

Topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then ideas perhaps less to the point but more philosophical.

- [Interfaces | Broader View](interfaces-broader-view)

- [Basic Diagram Elements | Broader View](basic-diagram-elements-broader-view.md)

- [Black Boxes Broader View | Loose Ideas](black-boxes-broader-view-loose-ideas.md)

- [Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled](commands-and-classes-loosely-coupled.md)

    - Objects of the same class might have a similar set of commands. But one particular idea for commands would be, that they might live as separate entities, not part of a specific class. The general idea would then be, that a command would automatically be available inside a class, if one of its parameters matches with that class.

    - This idea is let go of for now, because it seemed optional and hard to match with other ideas like encapsulation and containment structure.
