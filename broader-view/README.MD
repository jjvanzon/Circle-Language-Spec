Circle Language | Broader View
==============================

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

Not all topics might be mentioned here yet.

- ## Fundamental Principles / Exchangeability / Extensibility

    - This documentation describes the fundamental principles, that the new computer language is based on. Perhaps the most important goal of the new computer language is to melt together all computer technology disciplines, providing one clear language, that can express anything, and that everybody can understand. The *Fundamental Principles* folder makes a lot of promises about the new language, but the *Code Concepts* folder shows you how those promises are upheld. If you want to go straight to the definition of the language itself, go to the *Code Concepts* documentation.

- ## Expression

    - This part of the documentation may cover remaining topics about the diagram expression.  
     
    - The idea behind expression in general is that a program’s systematics might not be described by text code, but text code as well as the diagram notation may be mere *expressions* of systematics, stored in some other way, for instance a binary way as interlinked objects.
     
    - The diagram might be fully automatically drawn out. The metrics and positioning of the shapes and lines might get automatically determined. The diagram can be edited, which may result in changes to the stored objects.

    - Text code and diagram expression can be complemented by any other form of expression. Displaying data in tabular form is another form of expression. Expressing data and commands in a graphical windows user interface is also an alternative form of expression of systematics. Furthermore, certain objects have specialized expressions. For instance a sound object may be expressed by playing its sound, but not all objects can be expressed by playing it as sound. All expressions are considered alternative expressions of systematics, just like text code and diagram code.
    
    - Much of this documentation folder is a mere throw-together of ideas or pieces of text, that came out of previous descriptions of new computer programming languages.  

## Integration

- It might be that Circle language could be a new way to operate computers. Using the language it might connect to several systems. This folder is the bone-structure for future documentation. Also, hardly any integration software has been developed yet. This folder will contain any documentation about integration modules, that *Circle* has to offer in order to integrate with the rest of the world of computer technology. *Circle* is not meant to live on its own, but existing resources on the internet should be accessible, when working with the new language. Each integration module will facilitate two goals: accessing other systems using *Circle* and the ability to access *Circle* resources from inside other systems. As such you can access other file systems using *Circle*, and you can also access *Circle* resources as if it was a file system. That example would be called *File System Integration*. As such there will be systems such as *Database Integration*, *SOAP Integration*, *ODBC Integration*, *File Types* and *Module System Integration*. *Database Integration* will allow you to access *Circle* as if it were relational database, but will also allow you to access relational database systems using *Circle*. *SOAP Integration* will expose *Circle* resources through a SOAP interface, but also allow you to access other SOAP interfaces using *Circle*. *ODBC Integration* will make *Circle* support connecting to it through ODBC, but will also allow you to access relational database resources using ODBC inside *Circle*. *File Types* will allow you to export or expose *Circle* resources as different commonly used file types, but also allows you to access files of such types from within *Circle*. *Module System Integration* means, that you could for instance use ActiveX resources, Java, COM, .NET and other module systems using *Circle*. Also, *Circle* resources could be linked to as if they were for instance COM or any other module systems. Also, there will be *Protocols*, which will enable several internet protocols, so that you can access resources that are exposed through those protocols using Circle. Protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP, etcetera. It is considered quite important, that *Circle* in the future will give access to all those resources as well as be accessible by other systems through all kinds of different protocols.

The following sub-topics may be found under *Integration*:

- ### Translating From XML

    - This may be a tool to read out XML and show it as a structure in the new computer language. So it is not about saving and loading data as XML, but it is about taking existing XML from another source and showing it inside the new computer language. The idea came out of the design of the relational language *Creator* made in 2007. This idea will probably not be implemented inside the main module *Code*, but inside the main module *Legacy*, to offer access to XML. Nothing like this has been developed in the software yet. The documentation only contains a loose idea about it and is not a full description yet.

- ### Translating To and From Relational Database

    - This may be a module to convert a relational database to a structure inside the new computer language or to convert a structure in the new computer language to a relational database. The idea came out of the design of the relational language *Creator* made in 2007. The idea was, that this would make using the new language an option more easily picked. This idea will be superseded by *Legacy* modules offering the ability to access the new computer language as if it were relational database and the ability to display relational databases in the syntax of the new computer language. Nothing like this has been developed in the software yet. The documentation only contains a loose idea about it and is not a full description yet.

- ## Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language, Neural Networks

    - It goes too far for now to consider the possibilities inside the new computer language regarding these concepts. But they are mentioned here, to demonstrate, that they are things that need to be thought about in the future. 

- ## Automatic Object Formation

    - This is also a concept, that is considered to go too far for now. It is about automatically converting unorganized code and data into well-structured code and data, organizing it into objects, so that even when you would program something in an unstructured way, it can be automatically converted into a sound structure. This would be handy for trying to understand crap-code, or for reverse engineering compiled machine instructions, or to detect possible improvements to the structure of your code, maybe for deciphering the workings of a formed neural network. Maybe in the future you will not program in a structured way yourself anymore, but you just let the computer figure out the best way to structure the system. All in all, this goes too far for now, but it is something that needs to be thought through in the future.

- ### Debugging

    - The new computer language is described, but how to go through code step by step or debug it has not been covered yet. This documentation may cover how debugging is implemented inside the environment of the new computer language. For now it only contains loose ideas about it. Nothing like this has been developed yet.

- ### Macro Recorder

    - The new computer language should have this button to press, that records all user actions, that are undertaken. Then, when you stop recording, the user actions are recorded as a procedure, that can be called as a command to be executed in one blow instead of performing all the actions manually. You can also edit the command code, to fine-tune the behavior of the command. This makes it easy to turn manual work into automatic procedures and it also makes it easier to program new commands. Other programs have this sort of macro recording, and the new computer language should also have such functionality in the futures. Macro recording has not been implemented inside existing versions of the new computer language yet.

- ## Object Algebra

    - Object algebra is the concept of being able to math with the code, because the systematics of interconnections between objects are so straightforward that it can be turned into a form of mathematics. The documentation folder is still empty and no software has been made in this area yet.
