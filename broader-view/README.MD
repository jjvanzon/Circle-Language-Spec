Circle Language | Broader View
==============================

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

Not all topics might be mentioned yet.

- ## Fundamental Principles / Exchangeability / Extensibility

    - This documentation describes the fundamental principles, that the new computer language is based on. Perhaps the most important goal of the new computer language is to melt together all computer technology disciplines, providing one clear language, that can express anything, and that everybody can understand. The *Fundamental Principles* folder makes a lot of promises about the new language, but the *Code Concepts* folder shows you how those promises are upheld. If you want to go straight to the definition of the language itself, go to the *Code Concepts* documentation.

- ## Expression

    - This folder covers the different kinds of ways you can express systematics. The basic ideas about a diagram notation were already covered at the beginning of the new computer language documentation, because it was important to quickly introduce those. The diagram expression is also explained throughout the code concepts documentation. This part of the documentation will cover the remaining topics about the diagram expression.  
    The idea behind expression in general is that a program’s systematics are not described by text code, but text code as well as the diagram notation are a mere expression of systematics, stored in a binary way as interlinked objects. Much of this documentation folder is a mere throw-together of ideas or pieces of text, that came out of previous descriptions of new computer programming languages.  
    Text code and diagram expression can be complemented by any other form of expression. Displaying data in tabular form is another form of expression. Expressing data and commands in a graphical windows user interface is also an alternative form of expression of systematics. Furthermore, certain objects have specialized expressions. For instance a sound object may be expressed by playing its sound, but not all objects can be expressed by playing it as sound. All expressions are considered alternative expressions of systematics, just like text code and diagram code.

- ## Integration

    - It might be that Circle language could be a new way to operate computers. Using the language it might connect to several systems. This folder is the bone-structure for future documentation. Also, hardly any integration software has been developed yet. This folder will contain any documentation about integration modules, that *Circle* has to offer in order to integrate with the rest of the world of computer technology. *Circle* is not meant to live on its own, but existing resources on the internet should be accessible, when working with the new language. Each integration module will facilitate two goals: accessing other systems using *Circle* and the ability to access *Circle* resources from inside other systems. As such you can access other file systems using *Circle*, and you can also access *Circle* resources as if it was a file system. That example would be called *File System Integration*. As such there will be systems such as *Database Integration*, *SOAP Integration*, *ODBC Integration*, *File Types* and *Module System Integration*. *Database Integration* will allow you to access *Circle* as if it were relational database, but will also allow you to access relational database systems using *Circle*. *SOAP Integration* will expose *Circle* resources through a SOAP interface, but also allow you to access other SOAP interfaces using *Circle*. *ODBC Integration* will make *Circle* support connecting to it through ODBC, but will also allow you to access relational database resources using ODBC inside *Circle*. *File Types* will allow you to export or expose *Circle* resources as different commonly used file types, but also allows you to access files of such types from within *Circle*. *Module System Integration* means, that you could for instance use ActiveX resources, Java, COM, .NET and other module systems using *Circle*. Also, *Circle* resources could be linked to as if they were for instance COM or any other module systems. Also, there will be *Protocols*, which will enable several internet protocols, so that you can access resources that are exposed through those protocols using Circle. Protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, POP3, FTP, etcetera. It is considered quite important, that *Circle* in the future will give access to all those resources as well as be accessible by other systems through all kinds of different protocols.

- ## Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language, Neural Networks

    - It goes too far for now to consider the possibilities inside the new computer language regarding these concepts. But they are mentioned here, to demonstrate, that they are things that need to be thought about in the future. 

- ## Automatic Object Formation

    - This is also a concept, that is considered to go too far for now. It is about automatically converting unorganized code and data into well-structured code and data, organizing it into objects, so that even when you would program something in an unstructured way, it can be automatically converted into a sound structure. This would be handy for trying to understand crap-code, or for reverse engineering compiled machine instructions, or to detect possible improvements to the structure of your code, maybe for deciphering the workings of a formed neural network. Maybe in the future you will not program in a structured way yourself anymore, but you just let the computer figure out the best way to structure the system. All in all, this goes too far for now, but it is something that needs to be thought through in the future.

- ## Object Algebra

    - Object algebra is the concept of being able to math with the code, because the systematics of interconnections between objects are so straightforward that it can be turned into a form of mathematics. The documentation folder is still empty and no software has been made in this area yet.
