Interfaces | Broader View
-------------------------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

Ideas about this topic, perhaps less to the point but more philosophical, might be moved from the spec to here.

- ### [Extensive Classification with Interfaces](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/interfaces-broader-view/extensive-classification-with-interfaces.md)
    
    - Extensive classification with interfaces might encompass some ideas about how to use interface more where otherwise you might not, so that a more detailed classification of things might emerge. This might be interesting to form some sort of semantic model. Mutuality of commands automatically leading to mutuality of interfaces might be a simpler example of an application of such an idea. Or a grouping based on what a dependent object uses. The idea might be played with but might not be fully worked out yet.

- ### [Imaginary Backward Relationships](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/constructs-drafts/interfaces-broader-view/imaginary-backward-relationships.md)
    
    - Some relationships between objects are bidirectional. Some are not. Imaginary backward relationships might be the idea that even when a relationship is not defined as bidirectional, you might derive the backwards relationship on the fly in certain cases, because it might be useful information. Producing the backward relationship may involve scanning part of a system in which an object might be used or perhaps sped up by some sort of caching scheme.

- ### [Interfaces Group By Source](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/blob/master/broader-view/interfaces-broader-view/interfaces-group-by-source.md)

    - A specific application of interfaces might be when your object might get extended with commands programmed by other people, code coming from other sites. To have commands from others available from the object might be handy, but it may create overview if these commands are grouped by source. Also to maybe have grip onto the reliability of a command. This article tries to further get into that and how the diagram notation might look.
