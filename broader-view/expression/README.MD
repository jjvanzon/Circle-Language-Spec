Circle Language Broader View | Expression
=========================================

Overview
--------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

This part of the documentation may cover remaining topics about diagram expression.  

The idea behind expression in general is that a program’s systematics might not be described by text code, but text code as well as the diagram notation may be mere *expressions* of systematics, stored in some other way, for instance a binary way as interlinked objects. Systematics, stored in perhaps a binary way as interlinked objects, might be translated to a diagram. The diagram can be edited, resulting in changes to the stored (binary) objects again.

This folder covers the different kinds of ways you can express systematics. Perhaps in a broader sense than just Circle language alone.

Some of the documentation in this folder is are mere throw-togethers of ideas or pieces of text, that came out of previous descriptions of new computer programming languages.

The *Expression* folder contains the following articles:

- ### Alternative Media

    - Text code and diagram expression can be complemented by any other form of expression. Systematics can be expressed in all sorts of alternative ways, such as windows user interfaces, data grids, pie charts, tree controls. Those modules might not be sub-modules of *Code*, but more likely will be part of *Controls* or other modules. But it is important to denote, that systematics can also be expressed in all these alternative media. All expressions are considered alternative expressions of systematics, just like text code and diagram code.

    - The documentation of *Alternative Media* is not finished up yet. It consists of only one article, that is no more than a throw-together of ideas. Part of it are texts coming out of an earlier unfinished design of the diagram notation language.

    - The concept of controls being alternative media in which to express systematics was part applied inside version 2.0 of the new computer language. It had a tree control, that displayed and altered the underlying systematics, that were stored in as binary interlinked objects.

- ### Expression Mixing

    - Furthermore all those forms of expression of systematics can be mixed and combined with each other. You can use text (code) inside diagrams and you can let an object in a diagram be opened in a window with a tree control in it and have the window be displayed on top of the diagram. Or a scroll bar or slider could be displayed next to an object in a diagram with which you can the object’s value. As such, all forms of expression can be embedded into each other.

    - The documentation has not even been begun yet. The folder only contains a text document with a couple of ideas in it. *Expression Mixing* has not been applied to any software yet either.

- ### Specialized Expressions

    - Next to ways to express *any* set of interlinked objects, such as text code, diagrams and tree controls, there are also expressions, that apply to specific *types* of objects. Documents such as pages with text and video files can be opened in the appropriate view. A sound object can be expressed by playing the sound. As such there are user interfaces for specific object types: *Specialized Expressions*.

    - There is hardly anything inside this documentation folder yet. Specialized expressions have been present inside software forever, but the clear idea of placing it in the context of generally usable expressions and the distinction between generally usable expression and specialized expression is newer.
