Commands = Executable Object

### Loose Ideas

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

To incorporate in the story:  
that anything not allowed for command symbols, is allowed anyway, but generates a warning and generates alternative behavior, that IS allowed, because this allows direct conversion back and forth between a command and an object, so there will not be any loss of structure of you just convert an object symbol into a command and back again.
