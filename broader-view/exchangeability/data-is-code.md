Data = Code
-----------

`[ Preliminary documentation ]`

This fundamental principle is about the fact that a program will not be procedures operating on a database. Your program is primarily the database. Any bit of code that runs is just embedded inside the database, associated with a ‘table’ or rather a class. A table has fields, but it just as well has methods.

Procedures are only plugged into of a relational object structure, which is primarily data. The relational structure forms the lion’s share of the program. An objects simply exposes actions, that it can perform, or actions that can be performed on it, or actions that can be performed on the combination between the object itself and other objects. Anything an object can do or *anything*  that can be done *to*  an object is exposed through a method of the object. The object is related to other objects through relations between classes.

In Computer Language a program is simply a database with concepts and methods simply being part of it.

You should view your relational data as actually being the program itself.

You could actually put a breakpoint on a row of a table. Whenever an row is get or set, the program calling upon the row will break on that row.
