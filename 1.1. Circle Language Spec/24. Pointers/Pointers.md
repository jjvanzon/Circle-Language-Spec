Pointers
========
The 'pointer-to-pointer' issues seem to be a bit spread over the chapters. When a chapter is explained, afterwards it seems to evaluate how things would look in pointer-to-pointer situations. The idea is that all of those pointer-to-pointer situations might be put here in this chapter instead. Topics like objects, classes, interfaces, assignment, seem to able to live without thinking about pointer situations, and pointers just seems a single problem area that you might want to cover separately..
